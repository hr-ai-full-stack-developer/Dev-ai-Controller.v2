## 🌟 1. Product Purpose & Core Architectural Principles

**Dev’ai Controller** is a **generalized AI Agent Platform** rather than a single chatbot. It is engineered to orchestrate multi-agent workflows, ingest tenant-scoped knowledge, discover MCP tools dynamically, create automations from natural-language requests, schedule transactional emails via Resend, enforce operator approval before consequential actions, and deploy production workloads to the Cloudflare Global Edge.

## 🛡️ 2. The 7-Step Canonical Autonomous Lifecycle & Governance Standard

All autonomous workflows and platform agents strictly adhere to this sequential 7-stage governance lifecycle:

| Step | Phase | Canonical Name | Invariants & Operational Rules |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | `understand_request` | **Understand the Request** | Validates tenant boundary, authenticates session, strips prompt injections, and extracts core operational intent into structured parameter contracts. |
| **2** | `build_executive_plan` | **Build the Executive Plan** | Formulates deterministic dependency DAG, maps required tools from Tool Registry, assesses permission risk levels, and calculates SLA latency budget. |
| **3** | `retrieve_knowledge_tools` | **Retrieve Knowledge & Prepare Tool Calls** | Dispatches semantic queries to Cloudflare Vectorize, binds attached Title IDs (e.g. `monthly-client-email-v1`), and synthesizes pre-validated MCP tool inputs. |
| **4** | `approval_gate` | **Consequential Action Approval Gate** | Evaluates side-effects. Safe read queries bypass automatically; destructive, mutative, or external side-effects halt for explicit operator token clearance. |
| **5** | `execute_action` | **Execute Approved Action** | Dispatches payloads through authorized MCP and Cloudflare tool providers with retry circuits and exponential backoffs. |
| **6** | `verify_outcome` | **Verify Outcome & Compare Resources** | Compares actual returned outputs with expected resource schemas. Asserts zero drift and strict conformance to output contracts. |
| **7** | `audit_log` | **Audit Log & Telemetry** | Records every step, action result, verification outcome, and approval token in an immutable ledger with SHA-256 cryptographic integrity hash. |

---

## 🧭 3. AGENTS Workspace & Navigation

The platform features an **AGENTS** workspace structured into three integrated modules:

| Module | Purpose | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Automations Engine** | Natural-Language Workflow Creation & Lifecycle Management | 9 status tabs (Working, Draft, Pending Approval, Scheduled, Active, Paused, Completed, Failed, Inactive), Natural-Language parser, Attached Knowledge with Title IDs, 5-point Validation Contract, Approval Preview modal (`[CANCEL]` vs `[APPROVE]`), and Execution Logs. |
| **2. Chat & Multi-Agent** | Autonomous Multi-Agent Workspace | Agent selector (General, Developer, Knowledge, Customer Service, Design, Custom), Connected MCP Servers (Knowledge, GitHub, Figma, Resend, Cloudflare), Agent-to-Agent delegation (e.g. General -> Design -> Figma MCP -> Result), 7-step simulator. |
| **3. Agent Worker & Architecture** | Cloudflare Edge Runtime & Embeddable Widget | Visual blueprint of Cloudflare bindings (`[ai]`, `[[d1_databases]]`, `[[r2_buckets]]`, `[[vectorize]]`, `[[kv_namespaces]]`, `[durable_objects]`), Resend pipeline, and Embeddable Customer Service Widget (`/widget.js`). |

### Active `wrangler.toml` Bindings:

```toml
name = "devai-controller"
main = "cloudflare-worker.js"
compatibility_date = "2026-03-01"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

# 1. Cloudflare Workers AI Native Binding
[ai]
binding = "AI"

  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: 'You are the General Agent. Plan, ground in facts, and invoke tools following the 7-step canonical governance standard.' },
    { role: 'user', content: prompt }
  ],
  max_tokens: 1024
});
```

## ✉️ 5. Resend Transactional Email Engine

Email scheduling and delivery is powered by the **Resend API v1** integration:

- **Email Knowledge Representation**:
  - `Header`: Standard branded header component
  - `Preheader`: High-contrast preview text
  - `Subject`: Verified subject line
  - `Body`: Markdown or HTML content
  - `CTA`: Primary action button with verified target URL
  - `Footer`: Zero-trust compliance and security notice
  - `Signature`: Standard executive team signature
  - `Variables`: Dynamic client tokens (e.g. `{{CLIENT_NAME}}`, `{{MONTH}}`, `{{YEAR}}`, `{{INVOCATIONS_COUNT}}`)
- **Safety & Validation**:
  - The AI parses attached knowledge templates (e.g. `monthly-client-email-v1`) and validates syntax.
  - Verifies that no external malicious script tags (`<script>`) are present.
  - Refuses to invent missing recipients, dates, or signatures.

---

## 🐙 6. GitHub Integration & DevOps Pipeline

GitHub serves as the **authoritative source-of-truth repository**:

- **Repository Tree & File Analysis**: Real-time inspection via GitHub REST API v3.
- **Surgical AST Diff Engine**: Produces precise patches targeting only modified lines without wholesale file rewrites.
- **Automated Pull Request Dispatch**: Staged commits are pushed to isolated branches (e.g. `branch-agent-patch`) with structured PR checklists and verification logs.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Workflow**:
  ```
  Developer Branch -> Local Test/Lint -> Push -> GitHub PR -> Automated Lint & Typecheck -> Review -> Cloudflare Edge Deploy
  ```

---

## 🤖 7. Multi-Agent Registry

Agents are tenant-scoped and restricted by explicit permissions. **The model itself is never treated as the authorization layer.**

| Agent | Identifier | Role & Permissions | Connected Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General Agent** | `agent-general-01` | High-level orchestrator, intent formulation, tool dispatch | `knowledge.search`, `knowledge.add`, `email.schedule`, `agent.call`, `workflow.run` |
| **Developer Agent** | `agent-developer-01` | Code patch synthesis, GitHub PRs, Cloudflare worker builds | `github.read`, `github.write`, `github.pull_request`, `cloudflare.deploy` |
| **Knowledge Agent** | `agent-knowledge-01` | Document ingestion, chunking, and semantic vector retrieval | `knowledge.search`, `knowledge.add` |
| **Customer Service Agent** | `agent-customer-01` | Isolated public webchat representative with zero admin privileges | `knowledge.search` |
| **Design Agent** | `agent-design-01` | Figma MCP token extractor and component specification verifier | `figma.read`, `figma.create` |
| **Custom Agent** | `agent-custom-01` | Configurable multi-step webhook ingestion and database reconciliation | `cloudflare.read`, `email.schedule` |

---

## ⚡ 8. Automations Engine & Consequential Action Approvals

### Natural-Language Automation Example:
1. **User input**: *"I want to schedule an email on 31."*
2. **AI identifies ambiguity and asks**:
   - *Which month?*
   - *What time?*
   - *Who receives it?*
   - *What is the subject?*
   - *What content/template should be used?*
   - *Should it repeat?*
3. **User clarifies**: *"Send the monthly client update to client@operava.com at 09:00 on October 31 using monthly-client-email-v1."*
4. **AI inspects attached knowledge**: Loads `monthly-client-email-v1`, `company-branding-v2`, and `signature-template`.
5. **AI Knowledge Validation**: Verifies 5/5 checks pass -> **READY FOR APPROVAL**.
6. **Consequential Action Approval Preview**:
   - `[ CANCEL ]`: No schedule is created. Automation remains in DRAFT/INACTIVE.
   - `[ APPROVE ]`: Automation is saved, registered in Cloudflare Cron Triggers, and transitioned to `SCHEDULED`.

### 9 Automation Lifecycle States:
- `WORKING`: Being actively formulated or edited.
- `DRAFT`: Saved but not validated or approved.
- `PENDING_APPROVAL`: Validated and waiting for operator confirmation.
- `SCHEDULED`: Approved and registered on Cloudflare Cron Triggers.
- `ACTIVE`: Running recurring or event-driven automation.
- `PAUSED`: Temporarily suspended without deletion.
- `COMPLETED`: One-time execution completed successfully.
- `FAILED`: Execution halted due to network or provider error.
- `INACTIVE`: Disabled without deletion.

---

## 💬 9. Embeddable Customer Service AI Widget

Provides an isolated, drop-in customer service chat widget for any external website:

```html
<script src="https://devai-controller.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/widget.js" data-tenant="tenant_prod_edge_001" data-agent="agent-customer-01" async></script>
```

- **Zero Privilege Leakage**: Customer AI only has `knowledge.read` permissions and can never access GitHub, Cloudflare, or email sending tools.
- **Grounded Factuality**: Answers strictly from attached public knowledge documents without disclosing backend credentials.

## 🔒 11. Security & Zero-Trust Secrets Isolation

1. **Zero Browser Exposure**: API tokens (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`) are stored in server-side environment variables and encrypted using `AES-256-GCM` with 96-bit unique IVs.
2. **Untrusted Uploads**: Ingested files are treated as untrusted data, never as system instructions.
3. **Prompt Injection Defense**:
   ```
   SYSTEM RULES  >  SECURITY POLICY  >  USER PERMISSIONS  >  TOOL PERMISSIONS  >  KNOWLEDGE  >  USER CONTENT
   ```
4. **Least-Privilege Token Scoping**: Each agent receives only the tools explicitly granted in its permission array.
5. **Cryptographic Verification**: Every simulation and execution receipt is sealed with an immutable SHA-256 hash.
